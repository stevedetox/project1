        <!-- Short Bio of myself -->
          <div class="a">What's good. I'm Steve. I'm 34 years young. I'm Colombian but was born here in Miami; raised back and forth(since most of my family resides in Bogota).I have a love/hate relationship with South Florida since I've been here all my life. For that
            reason, I have traveled all my life and wouldn't mind at some point working remotely from sporadic locations so as to keep life interesting(digital nomad style, I guess). My mind is always all over the place so its not easy to focus on just
            once thing of interest for too long without feeling like I've mastered said thing or have grown bored. Constant change is something I try to strive for while evolving my being. Since there is so much out there to explore and learn about on
            a daily basis, I've gone down many roads of interests and passions in my short life. Some of these passions include:</div>

        <!-- Detoxification and Iridology Specialist -->
          <li>Cellular Regeneration and Systemic Detoxification. This has been my main focus for the past 2 years as a Raw Vegan. I also have a degree in clinical iridology, which I practice daily. I am a certified detoxification specialist and have a fair
            amount of clientele and people I speak to on a day to day basis. I assist those that want to know more about their current state of health and what they can do to make more impactful decisions regarding their mental/physical state. This is
            an extremely broad topic and I can sit here forever going over this, but I'll cut it short. If you'd like to know more, just ask. Just remember to keep an open mind. The Truth will always be truth. Whether you choose to believe it or not.
            I'll leave it at that. Get at me whenever though.</div>

        <!-- Yoga and Diaphragmatic Breathing-->
          <li>Yoga. About a year, I started taking a liking to yoga. Like everything I get into, it just happened randomly. It may have been due to the change of lifestyle that came after I started taking my health more seriously. Plus it was one of the best
            stress relievers I'd ever found that actually worked(along with diet). I started incorporating diaphragmatic breathing and sungazing, and started experiencing amazing results in my daily life. I don't go a day without stretching.</div>

          <li>Weed. Marijuana was a big thing for me for 15 years. Smoked it. Dabbed it. Grew it. Sold it(Some of the best from Oregon and Colorado). While it isn't a part of my life anymore, it still holds a special place in my heart. I Probably shouldn't
            elaborate on this any further either, lol. </div>

          <!-- Photogrpahy and Digital Imaging-->
            Photography. I dabbled for a while in photo(my last job was also in digital imaging).It was something I just picked up for the fuck of it and felt I had a knack for. I was hanging out with a make-up artist and another photographer at the time while working
            with Sony. We were vibing pretty heavy due to similar lifestyles at the time so I decided to buy a camera. Picked up on Photoshop and Lightroom, as well. Started networking soon enough and booking shoots with fitness models. I'd shoot anything
            just for the fuck of it; tattoo artists, weed, nature, friends, etc.. Some of my pictures from way back were on an old name I used to use called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alkaline.photography/">Alkaline Photography</a>(dont
            bother following..its a dead account for a reason, lol.)

        <!-- Film-->
          <li>Film. I'm a huge film geek. I'll watch just about everything but I am selective as well when it comes to acting, how a film is directed, and the genre(I'd rather watch a well written drama over a mainstream action flick anyday).Lately, I've
            been fucking around with friends and making short films on youtube. Currently we are working on a Wes Anderson style short. We also made a film last year(in which I narrated and briefly starred in) that debuted at a short film festival here in Miami; A coming of age drama about a young
            artist coming to terms with his past in order to move forward with his life. Your standard cliche' type of drama. Check it out below.</div>

          <!-- Video Games and Anime-->
            <li> Video Games and Anime. I feel like this often goes hand in hand. Especially if you grew up in the 80's/90's and never really fucked with sports(other than aggressive inline skating, but thats something else i do/did). I've always had a thing
              for Role Playing Games(all the classics plus some current greats). When it came to competitive play, I was never much into First Person Shooters(unless youre talking about the days of keyboard and mouse before console blew up with FPS).
              I was more into fighters. Street Fighter in general was what i grew up on and would consider myself a veteran fighter who played in many tournaments nationwide in my late teens and early twenties.As far as anime is concerned, I grew up watching
              some of the best anime of my time. Although there are some great anime out there, they are few and far between. </div>

            <li>Tattoos. or pain in general. Because we all associate with pain somehow(whether it be physical or mental). ALthough I dont get ink much anymore, I'm still deeply rooted in the tattoo culture. Being a professional body piercer and having studied
              the art of tattooing under some well respected artists/friends, It's something I fell in love with even before I started apprenticing at a shop. Artists love a clean canvas, and I didnt't mind giving up. Although not fully covered, about
              75-80% of my body is. Don't regret one bit of it. Even knowing what I know now about health and biochemistry, I still consider it one of the most beautiful artforms out there. Fucking sucks that its currently being butchered to death and
              corporatized..But that's corporate for you.</div>
